# Notebooks

Lightweight exploratory analysis, demos, or visualization notebooks live here.

- Keep notebooks small and focused; promote reusable utilities into `src/modern_llm`.
- Clear outputs before committing to keep diffs readable.
- For long-running experiments, convert notebook logic into scripts under `scripts/` once validated.
