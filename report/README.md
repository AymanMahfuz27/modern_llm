# Report Workspace

Use this folder for the proposal, progress report, ACL-style final paper, and figure assets.

- Draft the final paper in Markdown, LaTeX, or a notebook that exports to PDF.
- Keep large binary artifacts (high-res figures) in subdirectories to avoid clutter.
- Reference experiment IDs from `experiments/` so the report remains reproducible.
