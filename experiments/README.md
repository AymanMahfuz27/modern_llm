# Experiments

Store structured experiment metadata here (config snapshots, metrics, plots).

- Use subdirectories such as `runs/2025-11-16-lm-small` for individual training or evaluation runs.
- Keep automatically generated tensors/checkpoints out of Git by writing them to `checkpoints/` or another ignored directory.
- Summaries (CSV/JSON tables, markdown notes) are welcome so that the final report cites traceable evidence.
